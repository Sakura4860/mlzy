# ABSTRACT

The residential building sector accounts for a significant portion of global energy consumption, necessitating energy-efficient building practices to mitigate climate change. The metric most used in legislation and building codes to promote energy conservation is Energy Use Intensity (EUI). The efficacy of such regulation is often taken for granted, but as this study of a representative sample of over 800 households in Israel demonstrates, energy 'efficiency' is not necessarily translated into lower total consumption. Multiple linear regression and path analysis were employed to identify significant direct and indirect factors shaping electricity consumption measured for the first time by all three metrics: total consumption, per capita consumption, and EUI. Factors considered included building properties as well as occupant demographic characteristics, environmental awareness, and lifestyles. The factors found to be of greatest importance were, in descending order, house floor area, number of occupants, and building type (detached single-family or multi-family apartment). Other factors, including income, were shown to have an indirect effect. EUI was found to be an ineffective metric, because it allows greater consumption in larger apartments with the same efficiency rating for climatization as smaller but otherwise similar ones. In our sample, EUI for climatization decreased by about  $0.14\mathrm{kWh} / \mathrm{m}^2 /$  year for every  $1$ $\mathrm{m}^2$  increase in floor area. To address this, the research proposes implementing stricter efficiency requirements for large and detached houses based on a novel 'size-normalized EUI'. In addition, to promote behavior change in a socially equitable way the paper proposes the introduction of tiered electricity bills based on consumption levels adjusted for the number of household occupants.

# 1. Introduction

Worldwide, the need to enhance energy efficiency and conservation has been widely recognized in light of its socio-economic and environmental ramifications.

Estimates suggest that around  $26\%$  of global energy consumption is attributed to residential buildings [24], with a significant proportion originating from non-renewable sources [27,54]. Consequently, numerous policy measures are implemented to reduce household energy consumption. These policy measures encompass regulatory tools [36,39], the promotion of tenant behavior change [59], financial support [60,45], and technological enhancements[25].

The significance of energy-efficient building construction and retrofitting becomes evident in addressing the impending challenges. Modern building construction codes and standards, such as LEED, BREEAM or their Israeli equivalent, SI 5282 [49] emphasize energy-efficient construction solutions. However, as Janda [28] noted,

"Buildings don't use energy, people do". It follows that energy conservation also requires understanding the influence of demographic and socio-economic factors on occupant behavior and its interaction with the building properties.

Energy consumption may be measured by several metrics: total apartment/building consumption, per capita consumption, or consumption per unit floor area (referred to as the Energy Use Intensity, EUI). These metrics are influenced by different factors and may be used for different purposes[1]. However, according to Huebner et al. [22,23], none of the models incorporating these factors can account for more than about half of the variance among individual dwellings as measured by these metrics. This remains true whether consumption is measured in aggregate, per capita, or per unit floor area [14].

Total energy consumption is a well-studied indicator. It is mostly correlated with the number of occupants [22], income[9,21,44], occupants' age[42,56]and education[58], house size[2,37], building age [46,52]and building type [18,61,56]. Each of these factors has a direct

effect on energy consumption, but they may also have indirect effects. For instance, high income may support high energy consumption directly[9,20,21], but it also has an indirect effect since it impacts the size and the age of buildings [32,58]. All of these factors in combination may contribute to lifestyles that affect domestic energy consumption [3,4].

Energy consumption per capita is a useful indicator for forecasting future energy consumption patterns and trends at both the global and national levels. It is used in global reports such as the International Energy Outlook [26], or in local policy studies such as the Israeli Electricity Demand Forecast (Knesset [34]. Like total consumption, per capita consumption tends to increase as household income increases [55]. In contrast to total energy consumption, however, consumption per capita typically decreases as the number of household occupants increases, probably due to shared use of appliances such as refrigerator or TV set. This implies that a household with many occupants tends to be more 'energy-efficient' on a per capita basis [9,56]than an otherwise similar one with fewer occupants.

Energy use per unit of floor area, referred to as the Energy Use Intensity (EUI), is an indicator used to measure the energy required for space heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC). EUI is typically expressed as the amount of energy consumed by a building or a house in terms of kilowatt-hours per unit floor area per year (e.g.  $\mathrm{kWh / m^2 / yr}$ ). This indicator is typically used for evaluating new buildings that must comply with modern energy efficiency standards, such as LEED and BREEAM, that require better thermal insulation and higher quality glazing, and for building certification in the EU[40], as well as to estimate savings resulting from building retrofit [8]. The expectation is that new residential buildings that comply with stricter requirements for EUI will consume less energy [10]. To perform this role, EUI is usually obtained by software simulation tools such as HERS or EnergyPlus [11,13]. The simulations require descriptions of building geometry, orientation, envelope properties, climate conditions, installed HVAC systems and lighting, and incorporate assumptions about occupancy schedules and internal loads. The EUI thus obtained refers to the energy needed for HVAC only. Simulations of total household consumption, or consumption per capita, are not typically required for certification by building standards.

While EUI is used widely as an indicator of efficiency, several studies have challenged its effectiveness as a tool for energy conservation, noting policies that encourage efficiency do not necessarily guarantee energy savings [48]. The case of California is often cited as a prime example of successful energy conservation policy, including the adoption of building energy codes that incorporate stringent demands regulating EUI. However, according to Levinson [38], the reduction of residential energy use in California can be attributed to geographic and demographic changes, which are unrelated to policy or efficiency regulations. Furthermore, recent years have witnessed a trend of building larger houses in California, which may partly offset some of the energy savings achieved through policy and efficiency measures: these houses often have low EUI but nonetheless consume a significant amount of electricity overall [16]. Ellsworth-Krebs [12] suggested that total energy consumption per household might be a more effective metric to promote energy conservation.

Using modeled EUI as a policy tool or a requirement for certification has another limitation: gaps have been observed between simulated and observed building EUI, with modeled building EUI being substantially lower [30,43] or higher [14]) than the measured EUI. Modeling may not account correctly for discretionary energy use or activities such as cooking or operating electronic devices [30], which are affected by personal habits and lifestyles. Buildings that are used for the same purpose and located in the same climate zone have thus shown large variance in measured EUI[1,33]. Comparing EUI consumption among different sized houses overlooks the internal space division and occupancy patterns. Some ancillary spaces increase the total square footage of a house substantially, but they may also have infrequent usage

patterns [53]. Larger households tend to have a lower EUI than otherwise similar but smaller ones [7,29]; therefore, the indicator favors large houses that exhibit lower EUI while their actual total consumption is higher[5,17]).

Finally, using EUI as the primary metric may lead to social injustice. Tong et al. [62] found that in the US wealthy households tend to have lower EUI for house HVAC. Low-income groups, especially those with high percentage of social minorities, have higher EUI, making them more vulnerable to energy poverty and climate change.

To address the indicator performance gaps, Gupta et al., [19] suggested that using a single metric for energy benchmarking of buildings can cause inadequate evaluations. Several studies have proposed including the number of occupants per household as an additional factor. Capeluto [5] introduced an Occupancy Correction factor that favors smaller and more densely occupied buildings; Selvacanabady & Judd, [47] proposed to use occupancy-adjusted EUI in commercial buildings, instead of the traditional EUI; while Stephan & Crawford [50] acknowledged that using the number of bedrooms as a proxy for the number of occupants is not a reliable method, as bedrooms can be converted to other uses. Incorporation of local occupant behavioral models with EUI is another possible solution [43].

As has been shown, household energy consumption can be measured using different indicators, each of which has strengths and limitations. Moreover, the metrics are used for different purposes by different disciplines. Numerous papers, especially in the social sciences, have investigated the effect of demographic factors on total consumption, concluding that conservation policies must be implemented that account for occupant characteristics. In contrast, much of the legislation adopted in most countries employs EUI as a technical metric to guide engineers and architects in the design of buildings or to demonstrate compliance with building energy codes. However, as energy efficiency per unit of area does not necessarily lead to lower overall consumption, a different approach may be required. While several studies have identified this shortcoming, very few have proposed a practical alternative. None have discussed both the technical shortcomings of EUI as a metric and the need to couple it with a policy designed to address behavioural effects on consumption.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate a comprehensive approach for analyzing household electricity consumption that incorporates three metrics described above. Based on this analysis, it proposes an effective conservation policy tool that addresses the shortcomings of EUI as the primary metric. Using data from a large sample of households in Israel it investigates the range of factors shaping households' electricity consumption as reflected by all three metrics reviewed above, for the first time in a study of this type. It then examines whether the use of EUI does in fact lead to electricity conservation, and proposes a novel policy tool that can promote conservation more effectively while also supporting social equity.

# 2. Methodology

Detailed information about household use of electricity and potential explanatory factors such as demographic characteristics, socioeconomic factors and the physical attributes of the buildings was obtained for a representative sample of 817 households across Israel. Survey participants were also asked to complete the New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) questionnaire regarding their environmental attitudes. Household electricity consumption data for participant households were obtained from utility bills for a period of 14 months prior to the survey.

The average number of occupants per household in the sample is 3.8, of which 2.1 on average are children under the age of 18. The average house floor area is  $105\mathrm{m}^2$  with a large standard deviation  $(44\mathrm{m}^2)$ .  $80\%$  of the households live in apartments in multi-family buildings. Most of the households have medium income  $(34\%)$ , while high and medium-high income households are a minority  $(6.5\%$  and  $13\%$  respectively).  $69\%$  of the households are owner-occupied. For complete sample

characteristics see Table S2 (Supplementary materials file).

# 2.1. Location, climate and demographics

Although Israel is a small country, it has four distinct climate zones running parallel to the coast of the Mediterranean Sea: A - The coastal strip, which has a typical Mediterranean climate with mild rainy winters; B - the inland plain, which has a hot semi-arid climate; C - the mountains, which experience hot summers but can be windy and cold in winter, with occasional snow; and D - the Jordan Rift Valley, which is very hot and hyper arid. The rainy season lasts from October through May, and there is no precipitation at all in summer.

Energy consumption in Israeli homes is almost exclusively electricity, except for a modest amount of cooking gas. Approximately  $1\%$  of households use gas or oil for heating during winter [35]. According to a recent survey (ICBS, 2020) about  $90\%$  of households have air conditioning (AC), either as a central system or as separate split units in each room, enabling the occupants to set the thermostat for personal comfort and operate it according to their individual preferences and to their occupancy schedule. The primary end uses of electricity in Israeli households[14] are space heating and cooling (approx.  $33\%$ ), white goods (e.g. refrigerator, washing machine  $-32\%$ ), computing and entertainment ( $15\%$ ), lighting ( $7\%$ ), and water heating ( $5\%$ ). The relatively low consumption for water heating is explained by the fact that Israel is a sunny country and homes are required by the building code to have a solar water heater: electricity is used mainly for backup in overcast weather.

The Jewish Israeli population is classified by demographers, including the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, into several sectors based on religious devotion. Approximately  $45\%$  of the population is secular,  $25\%$  is traditional, and the remainder is divided into various religious streams [6], such as the ultra-Orthodox Jews. These differences are reflected in many aspects of their lifestyles, including family size, education, income, employment, and type of residence – and are thus expected to affect electricity usage patterns as well. For example, ultra-Orthodox households are characterized by a slow adoption of modern technologies and have fewer electric appliances than other Israeli families, but also have large families (nearly 7 children on average), have a low income, and live in relatively small apartments.

# 2.2. Data collection

The data were collected by a polling company using a detailed questionnaire comprising four sections (See Table S1, supplementary materials file). The first section (questions 1-11) recorded detailed household demographic data and socio-economic attributes, including occupants' age, education, employment, time spent at home, and home ownership status. Income was estimated based on a self-reported subjective evaluation on a scale of 1-7, relative to the national average income per household (given in the questionnaire). The second section of the questionnaire (questions 12-20) collected information about physical characteristics of the building such as building type (detached single-family, row building, multi-family apartment building), floor area, and location of the apartment (intermediate story or upper story). The third section of the questionnaire (questions 21-27) collected information about ownership of electric appliances, including electric heating and air conditioners, and their frequency of use. The fourth section refers to participants' energy use habits and environmental awareness. Participants are evaluated based on their consumption habits (questions 28-35), rated on a scale of 1-5. Their attitudes on personal energy use (questions 36-40) are rated on a scale of 1-7, and their general environmental attitudes are assessed using the New Environmental Paradigm questionnaire (questions 41-55), rated on a scale from -3 to 3.

# 2.3. Model development

Two methods were applied independently to analyze factors affecting consumption: Multiple linear regression and path analysis.

# 2.3.1. Multiple linear regression

As in several other studies (e.g. [51,57], multiple linear regression was used prior to path analysis to identify factors that had the greatest effect on household electricity consumption.

The factors that were included in the model are the number of occupants per household, adult education, number of children, occupants age, income, employment status, religious stream, dwelling floor area, house construction period, house ownership, energy attitudes score, consumption habits score, and NEP score. The analysis was performed separately for the three metrics of electricity consumption: total household, per capita, and EUI (for all appliances and for HVAC only). Multicollinearity was tested prior to the analysis (see Appendix A for IVF factors). The VIF for all variables is between 1.12 and 2.23. Typically, values exceeding 10 suggest multicollinearity; however, in this study, the values are close to one, dismissing concerns of multicollinearity.

# 2.3.2. Electricity consumption for HVAC

Electricity consumption related to HVAC was determined by identifying the month with the lowest electricity usage and then subtracting this value from the electricity consumption of the remaining months. The underlying assumption is that during this specific month (typically November or April), there is little or no need for climate control, so consumption is entirely due to other domestic appliances.

# 2.3.3. Path analysis

While there are studies that use only the path analysis method, other studies that had multiple explanatory factors have used MLR as a preliminary step to build the final model, and understand of the impact of the independent variables on the dependent variable.

Path analysis was performed with AMOS software using bootstrapped maximum likelihood estimates. Path analysis, which is a special case of structural equation modeling (SEM), is based on regression and identifies the influence of direct and indirect factors on the dependent variable. This method enables identification of both direct and indirect impacts of the independent variables on the dependent variables. It presents a complex model that simulates causal relationships among factors in real life [32]. The development of the model was based on the results of the regression analysis and a correlation matrix that was created to understand the relationships among explanatory factors (Appendix B). The variables that were found to have a significant effect on electricity consumption were defined as primary factors, while the indirect variables are ones that had a significant effect on the primary factors. The results are presented as standardized and unstandardized correlation estimates and a path analysis diagram. This method allows the reader to understand how primary factors, such as house floor area, impact electricity consumption, and in addition to assess how they may be influenced by other factors.

# 2.4. Metric and policy improvement

After examining the results, a two-step method was proposed to encourage energy conservation. First, several modifications of the metric were examined to generate an improved version of EUI as a tool for rating new home construction and demonstrating compliance with building energy standards, to account for the effect of different house floor areas on the specific consumption. The contribution of occupant behavior to electricity consumption is then addressed by a tiered electricity billing scheme that adjusts a base 'energy budget' for each household to account for the number of occupants living in the house.

# 3. Results

This section first presents the various factors shaping consumption using multiple linear regression for the three electricity consumption metrics (total, per capita, and EUI). Path analysis is then performed to synthesize the contribution of direct and indirect electricity behaviour shaping factors.

# 3.1. Factors shaping household energy consumption

Table 1 presents the analysis of factors affecting total annual electricity consumption, per capita consumption, and consumption per unit floor area (EUI). The explanatory power of the analysis was highest for total annual consumption as the dependent variable  $(\mathbb{R}^2 = 0.39)$  while models for per capita consumption and EUI have lower explanatory power  $(\mathrm{R}^2 = 0.29,\mathrm{R}^2 = 0.17$  , respectively).

As indicated by the multiple regression, the size of a house has a significant impact on household electricity consumption: large houses consume more energy. However, as house size increases, EUI decreases (by about  $0.4\mathrm{kWh} / \mathrm{m}^2$  for every additional square meter of floor area), as indicated by a negative  $\beta$  value  $(\beta = -0.5)$ . The analysis also shows that the distinction between apartments and detached houses is a significant factor, as measured by all three metrics. Detached houses consume

consistently more electricity ( $b = 1960 \, \text{kWh}$ ,  $b = 694 \, \text{kWh/person}$ ,  $b = 19.4 \, \text{kWh/m}^2$ ). This effect is independent of the fact that detached houses tend to be larger than apartments, and thus require more energy to heat and cool. Finally, the number of occupants is positively correlated with total consumption ( $b = 625 \, \text{kWh}$ ) and EUI ( $b = 5.8 \, \text{kWh/m}^2$ ), but per capita consumption decreases in households with many occupants ( $b = -429 \, \text{kWh/person}$ ), probably due to shared appliance use. Better education and greater environmental awareness (measured by the 'attitudes' score) reduce electricity consumption according to all three metrics.

The preceding analysis was performed for the electricity consumption for all end uses. However, building regulations typically focus on energy efficiency in the provision of thermal comfort - heating or cooling, as necessary. It is thus instructive to focus on electricity consumption for space heating and cooling only. As Table 2 shows, the main factors affecting consumption for HVAC were - similarly to the general household use - the floor area, number of occupants and house type. However, the explanatory power of the analysis was substantially lower, for all three metrics: total annual consumption for HVAC as the dependent variable  $(\mathrm{R}^2 = 0.22)$  per capita HVAC consumption  $(\mathrm{R}^2 = 0.19)$  and EUI HVAC  $(\mathrm{R}^2 = 0.11)$ . Adding additional explanatory factors such as income or house age did not improve model performance. The reasons for this are analyzed in subsequent sections of this paper.

Fig. 1 illustrates the main findings of the regression analysis, showing the relationship between floor area and the three measures of consumption. The figure has six panels: In each row, the figure on the left shows consumption for all end uses and the one on the right consumption for space heating and cooling only. The results are further stratified so that each figure distinguishes between apartments in multi-family buildings and detached single-family houses.

The figure highlights several trends: EUI decreases as floor area increases; total consumption increases with floor area; and per capita consumption is least affected by house size. However, the figure also indicates that there is a very large variance in consumption across the households in our sample, even once house size and house type are controlled for. This is true for all end uses, as well as for HVAC only, even once the effect of climate is considered. The reasons for this were investigated using path analysis.

The overall impact of measured socio-economic, demographic, and

building factors on annual electricity consumption—whether total, per capita, or per EUI - is moderate, as indicated by R-squared values of 0.39, 0.29, and 0.17, respectively. The substantial variance in electricity consumption is likely due to behavioral habits and personal preferences that were not documented in this study. Notably, the NEP questionnaire, designed to gauge participants' environmental awareness, showed no significant effect on electricity consumption. Meanwhile, although questions regarding energy attitudes were found to be statistically significant, their explanatory power of electricity consumption was very weak.

# 3.2. The holistic approach: Identifying direct and indirect effects

Given that socio-economic, demographic, and building characteristics can all influence each other, a holistic approach was taken to analyze energy consumption. In particular, as demonstrated in the

previous section, the size of a house has a substantial impact. However, as is evident from the correlation matrix and subsequent path analysis, house size is influenced by multiple factors that impact electricity consumption indirectly. The correlation matrix is presented in Appendix B (Table B1). Appendix B also provides a more detailed description of the direct and indirect effects (Tables B2-B4) and model fit statistics (Table B5).

Fig. 2 shows the path analysis model. The most significant factor affecting consumption is the size of the house  $(\mathrm{b} = 28.2\mathrm{kWh})$ . It in turn is influenced by multiple indirect factors such as identification with a religious stream  $(\mathrm{b} = -0.25\mathrm{kWh})$ , the number of household occupants  $(\mathrm{b} = 7.1\mathrm{kWh})$ , income class  $(\mathrm{b} = 7.5\mathrm{kWh})$ , house type  $(\mathrm{b} = 52.5\mathrm{kWh})$  and house ownership  $(\mathrm{b} = 16\mathrm{kWh})$ . While some factors, such as income, floor area, and house type, are quite intuitive, others require an acquaintance with the Israeli population attributes. Specifically, belonging to a religious group is strongly correlated with certain socio-economic and cultural characteristics. The ultra-orthodox Jews have large families, lower income and less formal education. Like low-income people generally, they live in small and crowded housing and have less environmental awareness, but in addition exhibit a very different lifestyle. Another attribute of the Israeli population is that large houses are mostly owner occupied, while those who rent typically live in smaller homes. This trend is exacerbated by the rising cost of new housing, which is

characterized by large housing units.

The number of household occupants also has a significant direct impact on consumption  $(\mathrm{b} = 591\mathrm{kWh})$ , and indirectly via correlation with floor area  $(\mathrm{b} = 7.1\mathrm{m}^2)$ . Another factor that influences consumption indirectly is household income. Affluent households tend to live in larger houses  $(\mathrm{b} = 7.5\mathrm{m}^2)$  that are frequently detached  $(\mathrm{b} = 0.07)$ , and typically own the property  $(\mathrm{b} = 0.05)$ . They are usually better educated  $(\mathrm{b} = 0.32)$ , and secular  $(\mathrm{b} = -0.14)$ . The number of occupants and income class errors share a covariance  $(\mathrm{b} = -0.183)$ , as well as religious devotion and education level  $(\mathrm{b} = 0.356)$ . This is due to an external factor that influences both but is not described by the current model.

Table 3 presents the total effect on the dependent variables of the independent variables, which is the sum of direct effects and indirect effects (for detailed tables of all three effects see Appendix A). While floor area and number of occupants are the most influential factors  $(\beta = 0.32, \beta = 0.273$  respectively) on electricity consumption, they are also influenced by other factors. Income and religious group do not directly impact consumption, but influence indirectly other factors that impact electricity consumption. Considering the combined impact of direct and indirect factors on annual consumption (Table 4), house type has the largest effect  $(3,267\mathrm{kWh}$  per year), followed by house ownership  $(973\mathrm{kWh})$ , number of occupants  $(793\mathrm{kWh})$ , income class  $(494\mathrm{kWh})$ , religious affiliation  $(331\mathrm{kWh})$ , Energy attitudes  $(-204\mathrm{kWh})$  and education level  $(-124\mathrm{kWh})$ .

In summary, socio-economic factors such as income and religious stream were not found to have a substantial direct effect in our case. However, these attributes have an important influence on the characteristics of the households' residence, and can thus be defined as indirect factors that impact domestic electricity consumption[15]. Path analysis, which considers both direct and indirect impacts, showed that house size is a mediator that can be influenced by several other variables such as income level, that then have indirect impacts on consumption. While the effect of religious affiliation is unique to Israel, the effect of income may be considered universal.

# 4. Discussion

The need for energy conservation has been widely acknowledged. Accordingly, governments worldwide are advancing policies targeting conservation in residential buildings. However, as this study demonstrates, the challenge is a complex one and the policies implemented might not be sufficiently effective.

As Liddiard et al [41] noted, the correlation between actual EUI and the energy performance certificate in London houses is very weak. The findings reported here likewise indicate that there is a very large variance in household electricity consumption – a variance that cannot plausibly be explained primarily by differences in the thermal design of the buildings. The focus of governments and regulatory agencies on EUI ratings as a means of promoting energy saving is thus clearly insufficient. This led Elsworth-Krebs [12] to propose that total energy consumption per household might be a more effective metric to promote energy conservation, and Capeluto [5] to propose an occupancy correction factor. Both of these approaches have merit, and the present study highlights the importance of assembling data on per capita energy consumption, which provides a very different dimension to the analysis.

The difficulty begins with measurement. Regulatory agencies

establish performance guidelines using EUI as the primary metric. Yet as this study has shown, buildings may be 'efficient' yet still require substantial amounts of energy for their operation. Building energy standards worldwide emphasize efficiency, measured by the EUI  $(\mathrm{kWh} / \mathrm{m}^2)$ , so that large apartments may be 'efficient' but still consume more energy in total than smaller 'inefficient' ones. Thus, if energy efficiency improves but apartment sizes increase, too, the objective of reducing total consumption may be compromised. The size of housing units is an inherent feature of lifestyle, and has tended to increase in many countries, including Israel, where the floor area of the average new apartment grew by about  $25\%$  between 2000 and 2021 (ICBS, 2022). Achieving substantial energy reduction over the long term may require a broader assessment of lifestyle as we seek to conserve electricity consumption in general. Similarly, by emphasizing EUI, building regulations ignore the effect of different numbers of inhabitants occupying apartments that may have a similar floor area. As shown by our study, the total consumption of a household has only a moderate relationship with EUI.

In order to address this problem, several correction mechanisms were explored, as indicated in the following section. A two-step method is proposed. The first step is to improve the EUI indicator as the main efficiency metric. The second step focuses on behavior change.

# 4.1. A modified EUI

While a uniform 'energy budget' for buildings of all sizes might be the most equitable solution, it is unlikely to be implemented in the building sector, since the requirements imposed on large houses are very strict. Area-normalized EUI provides a more realistic correction of the indicator, so large houses would be required to have a lower EUI in order to get the same rating as small houses. A similar provision may be found in the American rating for LEED residential buildings (Edition 4) which encourages the construction of smaller houses and limits the air-conditioned area.

Several options for EUI modification were examined. Referring to Fig. 3: 'Equal EUI' is the current rating standard, which considers only the thermal properties of the building, adjusted for the climate zone. The current standard does not consider the floor area of the building and rates all buildings based on the modeled EUI.

The 'actual EUI' of buildings for HVAC in our sample, based on utility bills, displays a very large variance. The curve in the figure is the line of best fit obtained from the data by simple linear regression, using the floor area as the independent factor.

'EUI for constant consumption' represents a scenario based on the idea that all houses, regardless of their size, should receive the same total budget for HVAC. To achieve this, a large house would be required to be

Fig. 3. EUI modification scenarios. Notes: The base consumption for a  $100\mathrm{m}^2$  apartment, based on our sample, was  $2,150\mathrm{kWh}$ . 'Actual EUI' is derived from correlation equation (linear trend). 'Equal EUI' is the current standard. 'EUI required for constant consumption' is the base allocation divided by floor area. 'area normalized EUI' is a proposed correction.

more 'efficient' and comply with more restrictive building regulations in order to consume the same amount of energy for HVAC as a smaller house. The basic budget represents the amount of electricity required to heat and cool an average apartment with a floor area of  $100\mathrm{m}^2$ , based on our survey. If it were applied in practice, the modifications required to the current regulations would be very substantial, such that large houses would have to demonstrate a very low EUI, which is not likely to be implemented in the construction market today. By the same measure, houses that are smaller than  $100\mathrm{m}^2$  would have much less stringent requirements, which might lead to higher electricity consumption.

Finally, an 'area-normalized EUI' would apply a partial modification to the current EUI, as shown in Equation 1:

$$
\text {n o r m a l i z e d E U I} = E U I _ {\text {b a s e}} + \left(\frac {\text {s i z e} _ {\text {b a s e}} - \text {s i z e} _ {i}}{E U I _ {\text {b a s e}}}\right)
$$

Notes:  $EUI_{base}$  is 21.5 kWh per year for size  $_{base}$  of  $100\mathrm{m}^2$ ,  $size_i$  is current house size.

This modification requires large houses to demonstrate a lower EUI in order to obtain the same energy rating as smaller houses. The base value of EUI for this calculation was set as the actual median consumption for  $100\mathrm{m}^2$  apartments in our sample. The proposed modification is considered to be sufficient to generate substantial savings, yet well within the capabilities of the construction sector using current technology.

# 4.2. Encouraging behavioral change

The large variance in electricity consumption highlighted by our sample (Fig. 1), which reinforces previous findings by Erell et al. [14], demonstrates that improving building energy efficiency in the design and construction phase is not in itself a sufficiently effective tool to reduce consumption. There are therefore opportunities for saving, provided appropriate measures are implemented. To address this shortcoming, the research proposes a behavioral intervention that seeks to promote conservation during building occupancy.

Economic incentives are favored by many researchers, but need to be applied in an effective and equitable manner. Conservation policies promoted by the energy utilities are primarily designed to reduce peak consumption, on a diurnal time scale but especially in extreme (hot or cold) weather. The energy utilities focus on total consumption per household, which is simplest for billing purposes. In contrast, per capita

consumption is clearly a more useful indicator in terms of the benefits provided by electricity to home occupants. Yet policy measures are not crafted to achieve this outcome. Accordingly, we propose to link electricity tariffs to consumption in a tiered-rate system, like the ones applied in several countries and in the State of California. However, unlike other schemes, we propose that higher rates will apply to individual customers adjusted for the number of occupants in the household. Thus, a large family will enjoy a larger 'electricity budget' at the lowest tier than a smaller household with fewer occupants. This will require each household to report the actual number of occupants to the local electricity utility.

The base electricity budget is calculated based on the average consumption for households of various sizes within the sample (Table 5).

The two-pronged policy proposed here has not, to the best of our knowledge, been applied anywhere. Both of its elements are novel in their specific implementation, but their practical application is fairly simple. First, the area-normalized EUI. Technically, the metric is simple to calculate. It must be adjusted to reflect energy use patterns in a specific country or region, based on consumption statistics - but requirements for EUI (where this metric is used) are already established at the appropriate legal jurisdiction and geographical scale. Tiered electricity billing is already practiced in some countries, but linking it with a per-capita 'electricity budget' is novel in this context. However, a very similar concept was applied in Israel several years ago to water bills, where the increments in the tiered rates have been linked to the (self-reported) number of occupants in the household. The policy met with

Notes:  
As the number of occupants increases, the consumption per capita tends to decrease, resulting in a corresponding reduction in the energy budget for larger households.

great success, and yielded substantial savings in water consumption upon its introduction.

# 5. Conclusions

The objectives of this study were to investigate an integrated approach for analyzing household electricity consumption and to examine whether current policies, especially the use of EUI as a metric for consumption and for building certification, do in fact lead to electricity conservation.

To do this, the study first identified the factors that most contribute to electricity consumption, using multiple linear regression. A comprehensive list of explanatory factors based on the literature review was drawn up and their effect on total consumption was analyzed, in combination. The most influential factors for all three metrics were floor area, number of occupants and house type. Factors such as education and environmental awareness had little direct impact on the total annual consumption. Overall, the factors affecting electricity consumption are consistent with previous studies [2,22,31,56].

Path analysis was then applied to investigate possible indirect effects of the primary factors. This analysis showed clearly that the impact of income on electricity consumption was translated through its effects on apartment floor area and type of house. Thus affluent homeowners were more likely to inhabit stand-alone houses or larger apartments.

Electricity consumption was assessed using three metrics. Total consumption and per capita consumption tended to be inversely related. However, the relationship between house size and consumption proved to be most relevant as a possible means of informing a conservation policy. As expected, larger houses required more electricity to heat and cool, and had a higher overall consumption (by an average of  $25\mathrm{kWh}/$  year for every additional  $1\mathrm{m}^2$  of floor area, in our sample). However, house floor area and EUI displayed an inverse relationship: large houses tended to have a lower EUI than smaller ones, all else being equal (by an average of about  $0.4\mathrm{kWh/m}^2/$  year for every additional  $1\mathrm{m}^2$  of floor area, in our sample) – to the extent of offsetting the gains made by higher 'efficiency'. Clearly, this metric, which is the primary yardstick for conservation policies in most countries, is flawed. The research thus proposed a revised metric, termed the 'size-normalized EUI', which requires higher efficiency (in terms of the traditional EUI) to achieve the

same building energy rating. This revised metric should be implemented by regulatory agencies during the building design stage.

The study results also showed that actual electricity consumption, even when measured solely for space heating and cooling, displayed a very large variance. This is attributed to occupant behavior and lifestyles. To encourage conservation of electricity, a tiered rate structure was proposed. Excess consumption beyond a base allowance would be charged progressively higher fees. However, the base allowance would itself be designed to reflect the number of occupants in the house: large families would thus have a higher 'energy budget' than smaller ones. Such a policy has clear social justice benefits.

Energy conservation in residential buildings is an important contributor to the concerted efforts made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Implementing appropriate and effective conservation policies is important, yet our study shows that to do so requires an understanding of the factors and lifestyles that drive consumption. Only then can effective measures be implemented. These may differ from country to country or even within large countries that have substantial climate variations. However, the methodology described here may serve as a useful blueprint for other countries, especially ones with similar climate and building characteristics, such as Mediterranean area nations.

# Model fit statistics:

Path analysis, as a specific technique of structural equation models (SEMs), requires model fit indices. Since the model goodness of fit is debated, it is common to present several indices. Table A5 shows the current model fit in comparison with values that are considered to represent good model fit. The indices confirm that the model is well-fitted and can be the basis for further discussion.

Table B5 Model fit indices.
